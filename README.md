This Library is a change of Neural Network library : NNetLib (see https://github.com/open-electronics/Artificial_Intelligence)
The change concerns just the internal nodes architecture but not the functions available. So, the library is trasparent for the user.
Actually, this library can simulate a Fuzzy System using a NN structure but with a kind of RBF (Radial Basis Function) for hidden nodes and output nodes that implement a 2defuzzyfication" fase with a weighted sum of hidden nodes activation.
For this reason this library comes with a couple of utilities: FuzzyDefine and FromNNetToFuzzy (both in source form and executable form for Windows10)
The first one let you to describe program in terms of Fuzzy Logic and traslate it in NN to load and use with library.
The second one let you to make the reverse process.
